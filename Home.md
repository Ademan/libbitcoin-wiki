*The Bitcoin Command Line Tool*

### About Bitcoin Explorer

BX is a major upgrade of the popular [SX command line tool](https://sx.dyne.org/index.html). Many of the commands and their parameters are identical to SX although many have changed, some have been obsoleted and others have been added.

#### Example
```sh
$ bx seed | bx ec-new | bx ec-to-public | bx ec-to-address
